# UCLA (Utkarsh, Chengwu, Liza, Alec) - Ortho App and Our Health in Our Hands (OHIOH)

Welcome to UCLA's landing page. You should be able to find all the information you want about OrthoApp and OHIOH from here. Please let us know if there's anything missing!

As a team, we have been working on two projects this semester. The first is called OrthoApp. The purpose of OrthoApp is to help patients manage their recovery from orthopaedic surgery (hip or knee replacement).

The second project is for a large ANU grant called Our Health in Our Hands (OHIOH) - see website here: https://www.anu.edu.au/research/research-initiatives/our-health-in-our-hands.
Our role within OHIOH is to develop an online platform for the researchers in OHIOH to recruit, consent, and manage their research participants. This is a challenging and exciting project as it requires dealing with interesting privacy and confidentiality concerns.
